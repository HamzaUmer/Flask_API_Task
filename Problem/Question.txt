Create an API endpoint in Flask that takes in a JSON object with the structure shown in the attached “input.json” file. 

This JSON object represents a tree of Movie/TV Show categories and subcategories.
Each category has a name and a number of plays, as well as an optional list of subcategories.

The endpoint should return the top level (root) category with the most plays, and the leaf subcategory with the most plays. A leaf is a subcategory with no more subcategories below it. If there is a tie, return the category/subcategory that appears first in the JSON object.

Keep in mind that subcategories can be nested arbitrarily deep (subcategories can have subcategories, which also have subcategories etc etc).

For example, in the “input.json” file, the top level category with the most plays is "TV" with 60 plays.
The leaf subcategory with the most plays is "Terminator 2" with 15 plays.

The desired output for the example input has also been attached in the “output.json” file.
